<article class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>“I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics. Then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that’s what I wanted to do.”</p>

<p>- Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest; not everybody gets university right the first time around. I enrolled on a total of 4 degree courses (including Physics, Chemistry and Art) before finally graduating with a degree in Architecture after 7 years at university.</p>

<p>I used to be ashamed of my indecisiveness but now I wear it with pride. I can&rsquo;t claim to be a complete master of anything but that&rsquo;s how I like it, I&rsquo;d rather know a bit about a lot rather than a lot about a bit. I think the turning point was when I heard Steve Jobs deliver his Stanford Commencement Speech in 2005. I realised that it didn&rsquo;t matter that you were putting energy into different things, it wasn&rsquo;t a waste, as long as you were putting energy into something, and staying hungry, you could <em>join the dots</em> later.</p>

<p>Throughout studying architecture I retained a strong passion and interest in the sciences and especially in programming. So much so that when I got my hard earnt Architecture degree, I decided to turn my back on it and go with my rediscovered passion in computers.</p>

<p>I decided recently that I&rsquo;d like to study Computer Science at degree level, mainly to help fill gaps in my knowledge but also to experience the academic side of the subject.</p>

<p>I recently applied to study a part-time foundation MSc in Computer Science at The University of Manchester and I was shocked by the restrictiveness of their admissions policy and the unhelpfulness of the admissions officer at the School of Computer Science.</p>

<p>The course I applied for was a Foundation course designed to help non CS graduates get into CS. On the face of it, it sounds exactly designed for people like me - The indecisive but motivated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they only let science or engineering graduates onto this course and they dismiss any other supporting evidence that you could be suitable for the course, including your degree (in other <em>unrelated</em> subject) and any professional experience you may have.</p>

<p>Needless to say I was rejected. When I asked how I could prepare myself for reapplication:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As your academic background is not suitable for the programme then it is possibly unwise to reapply &hellip; however if you can gain a good degree (2i) in a Science or Engineering subject then please do so.</p>

<p>- Admissions officer for Computer Science</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, don&rsquo;t bother. And if I were to go back and do a undergrad degree in Science or Engineering, would I not just do it in Computer Science?</p>

<p>The admissions officer also refuses to answer some of the valid questions I have around appeals and the relevance of my experience.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d really like to see universities offer more options for disillusioned but capable graduates to take side-steps in their career rather than having to start from square one, which is impossible for most.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve posted the full correspondence with the university beneath.</p>

<p>####My original message:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I completed your online application for late admission to the Foundation route to Computer Science Msc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering what will happen next and if I was too late for this year. I&rsquo;m very keen to join the course if there&rsquo;s a place.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a developer for some years and have good knowledge of the material in all the modules for this year so I think I wouldn&rsquo;t be too hindered if I&rsquo;ve missed some material.</p>

<p>I notice the track system says my application has been &lsquo;processed&rsquo; but I haven&rsquo;t heard anything.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be great if you could provide some information or an update.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Matt Harrison</p>

<p>####The reply:</p>

<p>Dear Matt</p>

<p>Unfortunately your academic background is not suitable for the Foundation Route to MSc course &hellip; the entry requirements are 2i degree in The foundation route is specifically for students who have a good degree (2i)  in a Science or Engineering subject but little formal training in Computer Science at degree level.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in the School of Computer Science,</p>

<p>yours sincerely</p>

<p>####My reply:</p>

<p>Hi [name removed],</p>

<p>Thanks for your email. That is disappointing.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to appeal against this decision?</p>

<p>I did read the entry requirements and I thought my position was strong based on the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have straight As at A Level in sciences and Mathematics</li>
<li>I have more than 3 years commercial experience in industry as a programmer.</li>
<li>I have a strong degree in Architecture (which although classed as an Art &amp; Design subject at Manchester has engineering material and requires a scientific and logic mind).</li>
<li>Although I changed my mind in degree course I have studied both Physics and Chemistry at The University of Manchester for differing times.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this isn&rsquo;t possible, could you please provide details about how I can prepare myself to apply for this course next time.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Matt Harrison</p>

<p>Dear Matt</p>

<p>Thank you for your email.</p>

<p>As your academic background is not suitable for the programme then  it is possibly unwise to reapply &hellip; however if you can gain a good degree (2i)  in a Science or Engineering subject then please do so.</p>
