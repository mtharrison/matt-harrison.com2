      <strong>July 5, 2020</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>I want to share with you my first experience working with GitHub Actions. They&rsquo;re really neat and definitely worth your time if you&rsquo;re a fan of automation.
Background This weekend I was working on a small personal project: a GitHub PR Comment resource for Concourse CI. That isn&rsquo;t what this post is about really but first a little context.
The project I was building is a Go project. When built, it consists of 2 built binaries check and in.

    <h5>
      <strong>May 29, 2019</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been playing around with Deno - the &ldquo;secure JavaScript/TypeScript runtime built with V8, Rust, and Tokio&rdquo;. The reason being is that this lies at the intersection of a couple of my main interests: JavaScript and Rust. I&rsquo;ve been writing JS professionally now for around 5 years and Rust very unprofessionally for just over a year.
Deno was created by Ryan Dahl, the also-creator of Node.js. Ryan introduced Deno to the JS world in a talk titled 10 things I regret about node.

    <p>Rust is an awesome language and platform to use, however there&rsquo;s so much great software already written in c/c++. Luckily it&rsquo;s not too complicated to make use of c/c++ projects in Rust. In this short post I&rsquo;ll show you how.
From a high-level perspective you can take any c/c++ project, for this example I&rsquo;m going to use Duktape, the lightweight embeddable JavaScript engine. I&rsquo;m choosing Duktape because it&rsquo;s very simple to build it - it&rsquo;s just 1 .

    </h5>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple of weeks learning about the art and science of Ray Tracing. Ray tracing, for those who aren&rsquo;t familiar is one technique for generating 3d computer graphics. Ray tracing isn&rsquo;t the fastest way to generate 3d images but it&rsquo;s appeal lies in both the realistic effects that can be achieved and in the elegance of simplicity of the technique. This technique is used in movies and for photo-realistic architectural renderings.

    <p>A quick guide to creating, packaging and using your first WebAssembly module with Rust, wasm-pack and friends&hellip; I&rsquo;m guessing if you&rsquo;re here you&rsquo;ve already heard about WebAssembly and you just want to get started building something without reading pages of specification, complex explanations or stewing your brains in binary.
If you don&rsquo;t know what WebAssembly (AKA Wasm) is yet, it&rsquo;s a new low-level language that can be executed by modern browsers, that traditionally only ran JavaScript.

    <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reading Leslie Lamport&rsquo;s Specifying Systems book. It&rsquo;s free to read online, but I bought the hardcopy as I&rsquo;m old fashioned like that.
Ever since I discovered TLA+, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated with the idea of using precise language to describe systems upfront. Often as developers we either don&rsquo;t do any upfront specification and just hope to wing it, or we very imprecisely add comments to our code as we go.

    </h2>
    <h5>
      <strong>March 3, 2015</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>Socket.io and hapi.js are two great pieces of software for Node. There&rsquo;s no official documentation on how they work together though. I&rsquo;ve seen questions about this several times on Twitter and Github, so I thought I&rsquo;d write a quick tutorial to show just how easy it is to integrate the two.
The listener Every hapi server comes with a listener property:
var Hapi = require('hapi'); var server = new Hapi.

    <p>Disclaimer: This was a weird idea I had one day and put this together the same evening. I&rsquo;ve not tested it cross-browser or in a production environment. I&rsquo;ve not benchmarked this either vs actually downloading all the images. It&rsquo;s kind of a &lsquo;what if&rsquo; project at the moment. If you think it&rsquo;s really dumb or cool, I&rsquo;d be really interested to hear your thoughts.
Generally, whenever a browser loads a new image, it will make a new HTTP request to the server.

    <p>This isn&rsquo;t an X is better than Y post. I love Express, I still think it&rsquo;s a really great module and I&rsquo;ve used it successfully in many projects.
That being said, I&rsquo;m hearing good things about Hapi.js (referred to as Hapi from hereon in) recently which is another HTTP server framework for Node.js. So I figured it was time to check it out. As most people who I imagine come to Hapi, I have experience with Express and I&rsquo;m wondering how it differs.

    <h5>
      <strong>March 24, 2014</strong>
    </h5>
    <p>Freshbooks is a great tool as a freelancer, for managing your billing and sending invoices. It is however lacking in a few places for me.
One thing I really want to see when I log in is how many days have elapsed since I sent each invoice out. Yes I could work this out from the dates, but I don&rsquo;t have the time quite often so things start slipping.
Luckily there&rsquo;s an API we can use, and I knocked up this Ruby script in 10 minutes to give me a nicely formatted view of all my active invoices and the days since I created them.
