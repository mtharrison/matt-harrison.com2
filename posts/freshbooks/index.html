  <p>Freshbooks is a great tool as a freelancer, for managing your billing and sending invoices. It is however lacking in a few places for me.</p>
<p>One thing I really want to see when I log in is how many days have elapsed since I sent each invoice out. Yes I could work this out from the dates, but I don&rsquo;t have the time quite often so things start slipping.</p>
<p>Luckily there&rsquo;s an API we can use, and I knocked up this Ruby script in 10 minutes to give me a nicely formatted view of all my active invoices and the days since I created them. There&rsquo;s no field in the XML output for <em>days since sent</em>, and I often prepare an invoice before sending it. However it will have to do until they change that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used the gem <code>terminal-table</code> to produce an attractive CLI table output:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the script, I hope it&rsquo;s of some use to somebody else (Note: Please remove the additional &lsquo;;&rsquo;s within the XML.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also added this to my path so I can call it anywhere with just the command <code>invoices</code>:</p>
